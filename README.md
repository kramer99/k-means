# k-means
K-means unsupervised algorithm for sorting samples into k clusters.

Will accept input data of arbitrarily large dimensions. Because I like pretty graphs and such, I've made it update plots as the centroids converge for data of two or three dimensions. Here, on uniformly distributed samples:

<p float="left">
  <img src="README_fig1.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="README_fig2.png" width="50%" />
</p>

...and here, on samples generated by choosing k uniformly distributed positions and generating guassian distributed samples centered on these positions in order to 'clump' samples together:

<p float="left">
  <img src="README_fig3.png" width="45%" />
  <img src="README_fig4.png" width="50%" />
</p>
